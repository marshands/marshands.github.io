I work in Appalachian's Behavioral Neuroscience lab (pictured below) with a team of students all deeply invested in their work. In this lab I have had the opportunity to mentor other students. 

Appalachian is home to "Impulse, the Premier Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal."

I am hoping to recieve a Fulbright or Marshall scholarship and do a research masters program at Keele Univerisity in the United Kingdom. This is a link to the lab I hope to work in.
